# Line-follower-robot
Smart Line Follower Bus Robot
This project features an autonomous bus model robot designed to follow a black line path using IR sensors and Arduino-based control. The robot continuously detects and tracks the black line on a white surface, adjusting its movement to stay on course. A special feature of this project is its ability to detect a traffic signal: when the robot encounters a signal, it automatically stops and simulates opening a gate (e.g., bus doors) for 10 seconds, after which it resumes operation. This makes the project ideal for demonstrating real-world public transport automation scenarios, integrating basic traffic management and passenger handling logic.
Key Features:
Follows a black line using IR sensor array and Arduino
Bus model design for realistic simulation
Stops at detected signals and opens gate for 10 seconds
Resumes line following after gate closes
Modular code and hardware setup for easy customization and extension
